# mc-server-management
Helps you manage your Minecraft servers.

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>You see, I like to play modded minecraft and so do my friends and I'm the one who usually hosts them, I'm also a programmer which means instead of wasting 5 minutes to download another java version because this specific modpack for some reason will only run on java 11 I will waste so much more time developing a server management system just so I don't have to ever again get lost in the bottomless pit of "find the java executable somewhere on this god damn ssd".</p>
<p>If you have the same problem this may help you.</p>
